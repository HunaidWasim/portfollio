               <p>Lahore city is the capital of the province of Punjab, in Pakistan. It is centrally situated and is generally known as “The Heart of Pakistan”, the city is located on the banks of river Ravi. It is also known as the “Green City” and is home to many gardens and fertile alluvial plains. The city is famous for its poets, artists and the core of the film industry.</p>
               <p>One of the most famous architectures of the city is known as the Lahore Fort which was built during Mughal Rule by Akbar the Great. This king also constructed the city walls which had 12 gates, some of these gates exist even today. Jahangir the son of Akbar, and Shah Jehan the son of Jahangir have been the builders of Shalimar Gardens in Lahore, they also have constructed many tombs and places. Another great Mughal Ruler known as Aurangzeb has also constructed another famous architecture in Lahore known as the Badshahi Mosque. These constructions are not only divine and beautiful but also great tourist attractions for the city. In the times of the Mughal era the river Ravi which now is miles away from the city used to clash with the ramparts of the fort and the mosque. When the British came they nicely combined the Mughal, Gothic, Victorian styles of architecture in the city. The architecture, beautiful history and the mixed culture of the city makes it a dynamic and vibrant city, one not to miss a visit to if given the chance.</p>

               <p>Islamabad the capital city of Pakistan, is one of the most beautiful cities in the South Asian region. Wide, tree-lined streets adorn the various sectors and zones of the city, making it accessible and spectacular. A meticulously planned city by renowned town planners Doxiadis Associates, Islamabad is the fastest growing city in terms of population, economy and urban development.</p>
               <p>The city combines a rich history, the confluence of many a civilization and temperate climate. The region has historically been a part of the crossroads of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Margalla pass being a gateway to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The city was built during the 1960s to replace Karachi as Pakistan’s capital. </p>
               <p>Pakistan is famous for its colorful and tasty food. You can find good restaurants in almost every sector; however, I would recommend the Tehzeeb Restaurant in F-8. Any caffeine cravings can be satisfied with a visit to any of the Espresso Lounge, Coffee Planet, Coffee Republic, or Gloria Jean’s Coffees outlets, other than almost every other café which serve coffee. The choice of drink here is tea, though, which is popularly available.</p>
